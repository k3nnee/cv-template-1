## Introduction
I created this template to help busy computer science students 
effortlessly showcase their work and skills through a portfolio. 
As a computer science student myself, I understand the 
importance of having an easily customizable and visually appealing 
portfolio. This template is designed to simplify the process of 
building a portfolio, allowing you to focus on what truly matters 
â€“ your projects and achievements.

This is just a basic template to make the process easier, add colors, change formats, make your website
pop!
